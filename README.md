# Coffee Sales Analysis Project - Sharon Mathurti 

##Project Description: This project analyzes coffee sales transaction data to identify key revenue drivers, understand customer purchasing behavior across time, and generate actionable insights to support data-driven sales and inventory decisions for a coffee business. 

##Dataset: 

The dataset contains approximatetly 3,000 coffee sales transactions, where each row represents a single safe.
Key attributes include:
Product name 
Quantity sold 
Sales amount 
Payment type
Date and time of transaction 
Derived fields such as weekdays, month, and time of day

##Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze coffee sales transaction data to identify key revenue-generating products, understand sales patterns across time (day, month, and time of day), and derive actionable insights that can support better sales and inventory decisions. 

##Tools and Technologies Used:

Excel - Data cleaning, pivot table, and visualization.
Excel Charts - Trend analysis and comparative visualizations.

##Analysis and Key insights:

Product Performance: Latte and Americano with milk generated the highest share of total revenue, indicating a strong customer preference for milk-based coffee beverages. Lower-       performing products such as Espresso and Cortado contributed comparatively less to overall sales. 

Time of Day Trends: Sales were highest in the morning, remained steady in the afternoon, and declined in the evening. This reflects routine-based coffee consumption tied to workdays. 

Weekly Patterns: Weekdays sales outperformed weekends, with Tuesday, Monday, and Friday showing the strongest performance. Sunday recorded the lowest sales, indicating reduced customer activity on weekends. 

Monthly Trends: Sales varied across months, showing seasonal fluctuations that suggest opportunities for targeted promotions and better inventory planning.

Overall, the analysis shows that product preference and time-based behavior are the main drivers of coffee sales performance. 

##Conclusion and Recommendations:

Introduce morning bundle offers(coffee + snack) during peak hours to increase average order value without increasing customer acquisition costs.

Prioritize inventory and promotions for high-performing products such as Latte and Americano with Milk to maximize revenue stability.

Run-targeted promotions or limited-time offers on low-performing days (e.g., Sundays) to improve weekly revenue balance. 

Align inventory planning with seasonal sales peaks to reduce stockouts and over-inventory.
